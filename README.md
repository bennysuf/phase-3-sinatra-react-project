# My Phase-3 Project - Twidler Backend

## What my project is:
    Think unnamed social media platforms suck? too political? UI isn't very good?
    Let me introduce you to Twidler, a social media app that allows you to have fun
    with your friends by posting your thoughts and seeing your friends. 

## How to start it up:
    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Run:
`$ bundle install` or `$ bundle i`

    Once your dependencies are installed, to give example data run:
`$ bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed`

    Then in a new terminal, run:
`$ bundle exec rake server`


   This will start up the Backend server.

   To quit the server, press CTRL + C.
